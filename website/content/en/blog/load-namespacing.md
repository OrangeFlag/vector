The Vector team has been hard at work improving the data model of events in Vector. These
changes are now available for beta testing for those who want to try it out and give feedback.
This is an opt-in feature. Nothing should change unless you specifically enable it.

## Why

Currently, all data for events is placed at the root of the event, regardless of where the data came
from or how it was obtained. Not only can that make it confusing to understand what a certain field
represents (eg: was the `timestamp` field generated by vector when it was ingested, or is it when
the source originally created the event) but it can easily cause data collisions.

We have also been working on adding internal type definitions to allow end to end type checking of
data in Vector. While this is not yet fully supported, Log Namespacing removes all the
possible data collisions that made calculating the types difficult.


## How to enable

TODO

## What

There are three distinct types of data that Vector handles.

(Examples are from the `http_client` source)
- Event Data: The decoded event data. (eg: the decoded HTTP body)
- Source Metadata: Metadata provided by the source of the event. (eg: the HTTP headers)
- Vector Metadata: Metadata provided by Vector. (eg: the time when Vector received the event)

### Event Data
An event in Vector now _only_ contains the event data.

### Metadata
TODO
